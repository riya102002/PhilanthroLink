#  PhilanthroLink

**PhilanthroLink** is an Android-based platform built to bridge the gap between NGOs and volunteers. It simplifies the way NGOs connect with volunteers by providing a centralized platform that encourages collaboration, engagement, and social impact.

##  Project Overview

In India and across the globe, NGOs often struggle to reach the right volunteers for their cause. PhilanthroLink addresses this issue by offering a real-time mobile application where:

- NGOs can post opportunities and connect with interested volunteers.
- Volunteers can discover NGOs based on cause areas, events, or location.
- A seamless, user-friendly interface helps both parties communicate and collaborate effectively.

>  **Problem Solving & Impact**: Implemented intuitive UX and Firebase-powered backend to facilitate **500+ real NGO-volunteer connections** within the first 6 months of launch.
